# Trami
## Introduction
This is the personal website about Trami to introduce study career and work experience.

I got my master degree from the Beihang University(BUAA).

I got my bechalor degree from the University of Electronic Sience and Techonology of China(UESTC).

My current research focus is **OCR**, including **Scene Text Dectetction**, **Recognition and Spotting**, **Table Recognition**.

## News

[09/2021] One paper accepted by ICDAR 2021(Oral): about the Scene Text Recognition

[09/2020] Refresh the ICDAR 2019 ReCTS competition in the 1st place

## Publications and Competitions

1. **RF-Learning:  Reciprocal Feature Learning via Explicit and Implicit Tasks in Scene Text Recognition**
- *ICDAR 2021 Oral*
   - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06229v1.pdf) | [Code](https://github.com/hikopensource/DAVAR-Lab-OCR)

![architecture](https://github.com/Trami1995/Trami1995.github.io/blob/main/framework.png)

We excavate the implicit task, character counting within the traditional text recognition, without additional labor annotation cost. The implicit task plays as an auxiliary branch for complementing the sequential recognition. We design a two-branch reciprocal feature learning framework in order to adequately utilize the features from both the tasks.

2. **ICDAR ReCTS: ICDAR 2019 Robust Reading Challenge on Reading Chinese Text on Signboard**
   - *ICDAR 2019 Competition Task 2: Text Line Recognition*
   - [Competition](https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=12&com=evaluation&task=2)

![ReCTS](https://github.com/Trami1995/Trami1995.github.io/blob/main/icdar2019RECTS.png)

We choose attention-based and CTC-based recognizer with data augmentation, and used multi-model fusion to predict the final result.


## Work Experience
- *HikVision Research Institute  Davar Lab*
- Algorithm Engineer
   - 04/2020 - Now
   - In charge of the text recognition related work, including routine maintenance an open source repository and training framework
   - Propose a baseline recognition model for Chinese and English recognition, and its performance reaches SOTA performance
